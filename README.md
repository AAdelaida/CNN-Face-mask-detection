# CNN-Face-mask-detection
This project uses a Deep Neural Network, more specifically a Convolutional Neural Network, to differentiate between images of people, with masks and without masks.

The training of neural networks requires a very high computational cost, in this case I used [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), Colab notebooks run code on Google's cloud-based servers, which means you can take full advantage of Google hardware, including GPUs and TPUs, no matter how powerful your machine is.
